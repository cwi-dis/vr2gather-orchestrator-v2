# Orchestrator external packages

The orchestrator needs external binaries, for the DASH SFU and the WebRTC SFU.

For now, we store hand-crafted copies here.

The `evanescent.tgz` package was built from a repository that will be open sourced in the near future but is currently still private.

The `webrtc.tgz` package was built from <https://github.com/jvdrhoof/WebRTCSFU>
